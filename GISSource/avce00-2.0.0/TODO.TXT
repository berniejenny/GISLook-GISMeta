ToDo list for the AVC Library:
-----------------------------

- Docs: new member in squeleton struct... update example in docs.

==== Known issues ====

(For the list of currently open bugs, see:
 http://bugzilla.maptools.org/buglist.cgi?product=AVCE00&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED)

- Windows-specific: 0 bytes allocation fails with arc with 0 vertices.

- There are still a couple of values inside arc.dir for which I don't know
  the meaning.  Setting them to zero seems to work... but these could be 
  investigated a little more to try to find their meaning.

- Potential collision problem if 2 processes try to add an info table to
  the ARC.DIR at the same time.  Does Arc/Info have any way to lock the
  ARC.DIR???

- ??? Add support to explicitly specify the precision when creating a new 
  coverage.  For now AVCE00WriteOpen() only supports AVC_DEFAULT_PREC, but
  if we added some code to convert the INFO TABLE fields precision from
  single to double precision and vice-versa then we should be able to
  create a coverage using a precision different from the one in the source
  E00.

- Interesting problem: sometimes tol.adf have missing tolerance index 
  (ex: 2 and 3), and they appear to be replaced by index 11 and 12 at the 
  end of the file.  However, Arc/Info still exports a normal TOL section,
   with 10 values with indexes going from 1 to 10... 
  (see single precision annotation.e00 coverage)
